Port Number VS IP Address

IP Address - used for identifying a machine
Port Number - used for identifying an application

Port number is just a random number. But there are some port numbers which are reserved for specific services.
For example port 21 is reserved for FTP. So as long as you don't use these reserved ports it should be fine.
